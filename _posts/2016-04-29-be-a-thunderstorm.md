Most people think a storm is a dangerous event, but those of in us in the desert and farmers know that it brings life and the abundance of crops. 

**Your mind is a parched land thirsting for knowledge. **

Beginning this year, you knew enough to get you off the ground and began to gather new knowledge. This was your storm starting to develop and seeds in your mind germinated. 

Currently, you are developing habits that will continue to grow as you learn and grow towards college. Now, in order to succeed through college and into life and not be a storm that fizzles out, you need to develop good habits of study and practice. 

**The mind you carry longs and thirsts for knowledge. **

Build your storm, and water your mind with the knowledge you gain. When you graduate, your mind doesn't stop wanting to know, but you can choose to starve it and be a life that sprinkled knowledge in a small corner - or you can be thunderstorm that pours down the knowledge they've learned and shares in the success that created it by sprouting others. And just like storms, those that join together are stronger! 

So, build one another up that you may celebrate in their success. For with each bolt of lightning, your hard work and motivation correct to make each clap of thunder in the storm is a celebration of success. It is your learning that creates the storm, but only your inner motivation to succeed can drive and grow that storm. 

**Your mind is a land in the middle of a drought and needs your help to feed it's thirst for knowledge. **

Don't be sprinkle; **Be a thunderstorm.**
